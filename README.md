Bi-ACTCNet: A Bidirectional Channel Attention and Mutual-Cross-Attention Temporal Feature Extraction Network for Motor-Rest Classification in Motor Imagery

Author: Lei Cao, Xiangrui Cai*, Yiling Dong.

# About Bi-ACTCNet
1. We focus for the first time on the Motor-Rest Classification task and construct the Bi-ACTCNet model to effectively decode this type of task, thus filling a research gap in this area.
   
2. We validate the effectiveness of the model on three Motor-Rest Classification datasets.
   
3. We propose a bidirectional temporal feature extraction signal processing method and fuse the features of two dimen￾sions using MCA, demonstrating that the reverse features in EEG signals contain additional information that helps improve model accuracy.
   
4. We address the issue of insufficient channel interactivity in the ECA channel attention block by proposing the ETCA block.

5. To verify the effectiveness and generalization of the model, we tested it on the 2-class classification of the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset, achieving good results.
